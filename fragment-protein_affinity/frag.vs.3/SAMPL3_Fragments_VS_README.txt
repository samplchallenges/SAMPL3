Thank you for downloading data for SAMPL3.  In the data packet you may find several varieties of files:

	.txt files contain an overview of the challenge as well as background information.

	.ism files contain isomeric SMILES strings for each of the molecules in the data set.

	.sdf files contain modeled 3D coordinates for each molecule in SD format.  See disclaimer below.

	.data files are example plain text files for submission of your data.  Please read the information at the head of the file which describes the required format for data submission.  Ideally, you should modify the provided file and turn it in when you submit predictions.

**DISCLAIMER** :  The supplied 3D coordinates of molecules are generally included only to provide an example 3D structure for those who prefer not to use SMILES, and these structures are not intended to be a particularly meaningful conformation.  Determining appropriate conformation, protonation state, and tautomer state are considered to be part of the SAMPL challenge.

The deadline for submission of predictions is June 20, 2011.  A complete submission will include the data file referenced above, as well as another plaintext file with a detailed description of the prediction method.

Thank you for taking part in SAMPL, and we hope this experience will spark insight and spur discussions regarding these predictions and the general state of our field.  We hope you can join us for the SAMPL workshop, which will take place at Stanford at the beginning of August 2011.

Trypsin Fragment Virtual Screening Challenge
******************************************************************** 
There is a large body of existing literature on trypsin as well as several high-resolution structures in the PDB (1hj9, 1s0r, 3mi4, and many others) and the structures provided here are only an example of what was solved.  We are interested in how published information or data is utilized, if at all, by participants in SAMPL3.  If any information is used from the literature to direct or affect your methods or thinking, please make sure to detail it in the description of your predictions.  

The list of the 500 compounds screened are provided in the .sdf file named frag.vs.sdf.  Cases where the screened molecule had unspecified stereochemistry, all potential stereoisomers are included and numbered with an underscore subscript, starting at _0.  Invertible nitrogens were not enumerated.

Please be aware of the disclaimer above about the 3D structures.  Results from the virtual screen should be returned as an ordered list of molecule names.
