Thank you for downloading data for SAMPL3.  In the data packet you may find several varieties of files:

	.txt files contain an overview of the challenge as well as background information.

	.sdf files contain modeled 3D coordinates for each molecule in SD format.  See disclaimer below.

	.data files are example plain text files for submission of your data.  Please read the information at the head of the file which describes the required format for data submission.  Ideally, you should modify the provided file and turn it in when you submit predictions.

**DISCLAIMER** :  The 3D coordinates of molecules are generally included only to provide an example 3D structure for those who prefer not to use SMILES, and these structures are not intended to be a particularly meaningful conformation.  Determining appropriate conformation, protonation state, and tautomer state are considered to be part of the SAMPL challenge.

The deadline for submission of predictions is June 20, 2011.  A complete submission will include the data file referenced above, as well as another plaintext file with a detailed description of the prediction method.

Thank you for taking part in SAMPL, and we hope this experience will spark insight and spur discussions regarding these predictions and the general state of our field.  We hope you can join us for the SAMPL workshop, which will take place at Stanford at the beginning of August 2011.

Transfer Energy Prediction Challenge
********************************************************************
The transfer energy molecules are provided as .sdf files, as described previously.  Please be aware of the disclaimer above about the 3D structures.  

Due to the interesting results on chlorinated compounds in SAMPL2, for SAMPL3 we have three series of progressively chlorinated compounds: ethanes, biphenyls, and dioxins.  Hexachloroethane was included in the explanatory section of SAMPL2 (-1.41 kcal/mol) and ethane (1.83 kcal/mol) is an oft-used molecule in many transfer energy training sets.  They have both been included in SAMPL3 for completeness in the series.
